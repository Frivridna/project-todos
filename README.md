# Project Todos



## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

If this project would have been with a fetch request I would make it more energy efficient, sending props from parent to child component instead of getting data from global store in each of the components for the different categories. And if I were to re-do the project I would choose a different styling, where things would move around on the page to get all the features to actually have space also on iPad etc. 

I would also work with React datepicker so the user could choose a due date for their todos -----> jag vill ha detta fÃ¶rklarat i pull request!!
